# **Bamazon**

This is a CLI app that allows for three users: a customer, manager, and supervisor. These three users interact with a database that contains products for sale, and relevant information about those products. Videos (no sound) demonstrating the app's functionality can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_oaUb4OReHCiDNo42zTlRyZI7wBufOOQ). They are also included in this repository's [Video demos folder](https://github.com/CrypticWoodWhite/Bamazon/tree/master/Video%20demos).
